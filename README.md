# DLP Scanner - A simple firefox plugin

A simple firefox plugin which scans the currently loaded web page for presence of credit card & social security numbers and highlight them. In case of forms, the plugin warns the user if she is submitting either of the aforementioned personal data.

Regex matching is employed. Support for more forms of personal data can be added by simply adding the corresponding regexes to match against.
